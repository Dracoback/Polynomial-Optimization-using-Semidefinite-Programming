\chapter{Introduction}

Optimization is a topic in mathematics that has many practical uses. It is always helpful to know what the best possible outcome for a given problem may be. However, optimization is a topic that is barely discussed in the undergraduate curriculum. There is a brief discussion of the simplex method for linear programming, but overall the topic of optimization is left off the table. This can be attributed in part to the lack of ability to perform most optimization algorithms by hand. It can also be attributed to the amount of mathematical insight required to comprehend more complicated optimization problems.

In this thesis, we will explore semidefinite programming, a branch of conic programming that will allow us to tackle some polynomial optimization problems. Our goal is to minimize a polynomial $p(x)$. We will show how we can approximate the answer to this problem with the use of semidefinite matrices.

In Chapter 2, we will introduce the concept of a dual problem and discuss how it is used to create conditions for optimality. Chapter 2 will also discuss linear, conic, and semidefinite programming. In Chapter 3, we will discuss nonnegative polynomials and their relation to sum-of-squares polynomials. We will then show how sum-of-squares polynomials can be rewritten using a semidefinite matrix, and use that to create polynomial optimization problems using sum-of-squares polynomials and semidefinite programming. We will then wrap up Chapter 3 with some numerical tests of our solvers, as well as show how to solve the problem of obtaining wireless coverage using minimum transmission.
